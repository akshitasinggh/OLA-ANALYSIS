Project Title: Synthetic Ride Booking Data Generation and Analysis â€“ Bengaluru City

Description:
Simulated and generated a dataset of 1,00,000 ride bookings for a month in Bengaluru, incorporating real-world ride patterns, cancellation behavior, and user ratings. Implemented realistic distributions for booking statuses (success, cancellation, incomplete), time-based demand (weekends, match days), ride value, and geolocation logic (pickup/drop from 50 dummy locations). Used Python (pandas, numpy, datetime) for data creation and exported to CSV/Excel for analytics and dashboarding in Excel/Power BI.

Key Skills: Python, MYSQL, Data Simulation, Excel, CSV/Excel Export, Data Cleaning, Business Logic Modeling
